def wallpaper(l, w, h):
    """ John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right;
    John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The
    standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind
    however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he
    wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs;
    Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John?

    Your function wallpaper(l, w, h) should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must
    buy;

    Examples:
        wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) => "ten"
        wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) => "zero"

    Args:
        l (float): room length (can be 0)
        w (float): room width (can be 0)
        h (float): room height (can be 0)

    Returns:
        str: string value for a number of wallpaper rolls
    """
    if not l or not w or not h:
        return 'zero'
    width, length, perimeter = 0.52, 10, l * 2 + w * 2
    numbers = {0: "zero", 1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four", 5: "five", 6: "six", 7: "seven", 8: "eight",
               9: "nine", 10: "ten", 11: "eleven", 12: "twelve", 13: "thirteen", 14: "fourteen", 15: "fifteen",
               16: "sixteen", 17: "seventeen", 18: "eighteen", 19: "nineteen", 20: "twenty"}
    return numbers[math.ceil((((perimeter / width) * h) / length) * 1.15)]
